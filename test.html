Men may experience symptoms of low testosterone in the 40s to 50. <br /><br />Hormone Importance <br /><br />The human body's hormone system is crucial in almost every one of bodily functions. Hormones are a communication channel for all cells within our body. They assist in growth in digestion, sexual health reproductive system, immune system, cerebral health, and many other things.

These are progesterone and estrogen. Women also produce a smaller quantity of testosterone. In some cases, testosterone levels are lower in women, so this hormone must be replenished. <br /><br />Hormone Replacement Therapy Charlotte bio-identical treatment for women is a customized therapy treatment when women are having menopausal issues and perimenopausal. Women more commonly have low hormone, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels after a hysterectomy or aging. <br /><br />As women experience menopausal changes, men too experience andropause, also known as Low-T. While not always associated with aging, andropause can occur in young men when they have a stressful life or abuse their bodies with drugs or alcohol. For males, HRT is nature's way to say that our bodies are aging. But HRT still helps the body to regulate how the process takes place and the way men can quickly adjust to the effects of it.</p>
